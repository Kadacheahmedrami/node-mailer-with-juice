**Project Configuration**

This document explains how to configure the environment variables used by the application, including how to set up your SMTP credentials and obtain the `SMTP_PASS` (SMTP password).

---

## 1. Prerequisites

* A working copy of the project repository on your local machine.
* Node.js ‚â• 14, Python ‚â• 3.7, or your project's required runtime installed.
* Access to an SMTP mail provider (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, or your organization‚Äôs mail server).

---

## 2. Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables to store sensitive information. These variables must be defined in a `.env` file in the project root.

### 2.1 `.env` File

Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project (next to `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, or equivalent) and add the following entries:

```dotenv
# SMTP credentials for sending emails
SMTP_USER=a_kadache@estin.dz
SMTP_PASS=YOUR_SMTP_PASSWORD
```

> **Note:** Do **not** commit your `.env` file to version control. Add it to your `.gitignore`.

## 3. How to Obtain `SMTP_PASS`

`SMTP_PASS` is the password (or app‚Äëspecific password) used to authenticate with your SMTP provider. The steps to obtain it vary depending on your mail service.

## 4. Verifying Your Setup

After creating your `.env` file with the correct values, restart your application. Look for success messages like:

```
SMTP connection established successfully.
```

If you encounter errors, verify:

* Your `SMTP_USER` is the full email address.
* Your `SMTP_PASS` is correct (especially watch for extra spaces or line breaks).
* Less secure apps / app passwords are enabled in your mail provider‚Äôs settings.

## 5. Security Considerations

* **Never** commit `.env` or plain‚Äêtext passwords to version control.
* Use environment‚Äêspecific secrets management in production (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Docker secrets).
* Rotate your SMTP password periodically for increased security.
